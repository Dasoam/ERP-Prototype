# ERP-Prototype

**ERP-Prototype** is an experimental Android-based prototype for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This project demonstrates the foundational structure and setup of an ERP application, intended for educational, research, or internal prototyping purposes.

---

## Project Overview

ERP-Prototype provides a modular foundation for building ERP solutions on Android. It is designed to showcase how various ERP modules (such as user management, resource tracking, and reporting) can be structured within a modern Android application using best practices like Gradle build configuration and modular project organization.

---

## Features

- **Modular Android Architecture:** Organized for scalability and maintainability.
- **Gradle Build System:** Standardized build scripts for easy dependency management.
- **Prototype Ready:** Easily extendable for additional ERP modules or features.
- **MIT Licensed:** Open for use, modification, and distribution under the MIT License.

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of the main directories and files in the repository:

| Path               | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/`             | Main Android application module; contains source code and resources. |
| `gradle/wrapper/`  | Gradle wrapper files for consistent build environment.           |
| `.gitignore`       | Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.            |
| `build.gradle`     | Project-level Gradle build configuration.                        |
| `gradle.properties`| Project-wide Gradle settings and properties.                     |
| `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat` | Scripts to run Gradle commands on Unix/Windows.           |
| `local.properties` | Local environment settings (not committed to version control).   |
| `settings.gradle`  | Lists modules included in the Gradle build.                      |
| `LICENSE`          | MIT license file.                                                |

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dasoam/ERP-Prototype.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in Android Studio.**
3. **Configure your local environment:**  
   Ensure you have a valid `local.properties` file with your Android SDK path.
4. **Build and run the app** on an emulator or Android device.

## Extending the Prototype

- Add new modules or features by creating additional packages within the `app` module.
- Update `build.gradle` files to manage dependencies for new components.
- Follow Android best practices for UI, data management, and modularization.
